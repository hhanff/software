\chapter{Method of work}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Literature search: Our project started with an extensive literature search. Therefor our supervisors equipped us with a Master Thesis (author: Claes Mattson), two abstracts over PSD's and a book containing information important for the development of the readout system. 
	\item Development of new masks: A group consisting of two persons was since then occupied with the development of the new masks. 
	\item Development of readout electronic: The other two persons were occupied with the development of the readoutelectronic. A few changes were applied to the readoutelectronic which is described in Claes Mattsons Master Thesis. For exampel a T-network was used in the current mirror . The active Bessel Filter was successfully simulated with Electronics Workbench. To do testing tasks, the current mirror was built up on a simulation board.
